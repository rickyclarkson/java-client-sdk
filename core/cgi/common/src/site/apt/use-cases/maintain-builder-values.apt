 Maintain Builder values
 -----------------------

Keep Builder values so that each client module can update and access them.

* Summary:

 Each CGI module has one or more Builders, which need to store and retrieve values, with various constraints.  The constraints are common between the Builders, and have similar functionality in terms of generating and parsing textual representations of the stored values.  Therefore, this module will implement that common functionality centrally.  Each module should be able to use this module to store and retrieve values for the implementation of Builders.
