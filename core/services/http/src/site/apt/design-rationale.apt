Design Rationale

 <This document should serve as a record of all the design decisions that have been taken during the course of developing this module. It should be a living document that grows as the functionality of the product changes. It should be updated whenever a solution to a problem is considered, and should record the reasons why each solution was or was not chosen. It is not an up-front design document, nor should it be written retrospectively, it should be updated almost as often as the code itself.>
