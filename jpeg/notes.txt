JPEG decoder API

utility code - static - getComment() etc.

>= 3 implementations:
   ImageIO
   Toolkit
   ADFFMPEG
   ..

Performance tests.

svn/adffmpeg-java uses swig
gensrc = swig's output.
swig.org has docs.

In Swig's output, direct ByteBuffers wrap structs, and the generated
classes just contain a pointer to the struct.

We statically link to adffmpeg to avoid library loading issues.

http://192.168.106.22:8080 is the Mac build server.

In adffmpeg-java, maven runs maven-exec.sh

Typical resolutions are 2cif and cif, but hi-res cameras need support
and performance tests too.

cif = 352 x 288
4cif = 704 x 576

Not sure what 2cif is then.  Perhaps 500ish x 400ish?

Can ImageIO use ffmpeg?

svn-old/uk-org-netvu/legacy/ffmpegcodec/FFMPEGCodec.java

VLC has Java bindings but not directly to ffmpeg.
jffmpeg is a dead Java port.
fmj is an open source jmf.
Pegasus Video on Windows.

VirtualBox for testing Windows stuff?

Use Cases: ByteBuffer => BufferedImage for decoding, and ByteBuffer =>
arbitrary stuff for parsing out JPEG comment blocks etc.

Benchmarks aren't to be run like unit tests, but maybe some will,
depending on how long they take.  Fine in Scala.

Rationale including benchmarking.  Other JPEG libs.
